#  CommunityTable is an open source project organized by the Community Tables initiative. It is a technical expression of a much more essential human drive to support <em>neighbors helping neighbors</em>.<br/>\
#  </br>\
#  <strong>Far Vision:</strong> The most vulnerable among us often suffer alone, with limited resources and often without hope. Community Tables builds highly localizable software to strengthen and renew the social contract among neighbors, so that no one struggles in isolation again.

vision.title_3=Backstory
vision.body_3=Community Table is a dream that dropped into my heart a few years ago. From the time I was a \
  little girl I have longed to see people from every walk of life come together in a way that is supportive, \
  heart-felt, and prosperous. The image which conveys my vision best would be that of an endlessly long table \
  filled with shining faces and open hearts, honoring one another, sharing resources, enjoying fellowship, and \
  finding meaning in life. God has asked us all to pull up to his table and be part of his family and we want to \
  extend that invitation through Community Table.
