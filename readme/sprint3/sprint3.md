# Sprint 3 (11/28-12/7)

## Forecast

We forecasted we could get **26 story points** done during this sprint.

The forecast correlated to the next four stories from our [Ordered Product Backlog](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#initial-product-backlog-order), with the 'Vision' Page story being introduced based on stakeholder feedback after release1:

| __Number__ | __Title__ | __Story Points__ | __Summary__
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Admin create blog entry | 13 pts | As site owner, I want to post a variety of articles about events, outcomes, and needs so that community members can be inspired and informed. |
| 2. | Admin delete blog entry | 5 pts | As site owner, I want to be able to delete previously created blog entries, so that I can remove older content or modify posts. |
| 3. | Public view blog entries | 8 pts | As a member, I want to view a list of all blog entries, ordered by date, newest to oldest. |

## Actual

We were able to hit our forecasted value in the sprint (reference our [Definition of Done](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done)).
 A summary of [release2](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/README.md#release-2-notes) is is given in the main readme.

## Burndown

Our burndown is based on the completion of each user story's [Sprint Task Checklist](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint2/sprint2.md#acceptance-criteria-and-sprint-tasks) (shown above) which were decomposed from the PBIs committed to the sprint. The last item is always "Meets Definition of Done" ([ref](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done)). 

Subsequently, our Definition of Done has a checklist item for "Acceptance criteria completed" which corresponds to the specific acceptance criteria of each user story (also shown above).
